# 3 - Enumeration

### Banner grabbing

Attempting to identify service versions can be accomplished through scanning or a technique known as "banner grabbing."  When banner grabbing we establish a connection to the service in question and attempt to retrieve information from the service, which often includes the version.  

```text
nc 10.11.1.5 4445
telnet 10.10.10.10 port
```

### 21 - FTP

FTP versions are typically fairly secure.  Check for anonymous login capability, if present enumerate whatever you have access to.

* Version info \(banner grab\)
* Anonymous logins - surprisingly common, especially in CTFs

```text
ftp 10.11.1.5
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to place FTP into the proper mode when transferring files \(binary for executable files and ASCII for text documents.  Use "binary" and "ascii" to change modes.
{% endhint %}

### 22 - SSH

SSH is not typically vulnerable but it often a candidate for password reuse attacks.  When enumerating you should check for:

* Version info \(banner grab\)
* Anonymous logins - rare but worth a shot

```text
ssh 10.10.10.5
```

### 25 - SMTP

```text
nc -nv $targetip 25
telnet $targetip 25
VRFY - asks the server to verify an email address
EXPN - asks the server for the membership of a mailing list
```

### 80/443 - HTTP

HTTP is typically one of the most rewarding exploitation vectors.  Because of the wide range of technologies and implementations, HTTP servers are challenging to secure--which is a great opportunity for pentesters.  When reviewing web servers/applications, here are some areas to focus on.

#### When enumerating, try to answer the following questions:

* What function does the application perform?
* What technologies and software services are present on the server? 
  * Database, OS, Web server
* What language is the application written in?

#### Open a web proxy \(Burp or Zap\) and review the web page in a browser

* Identify links, input fields, login pages, etc.
* Note version or software information--many CMS have known exploits
* Review the page source, look for version info, comments, etc.
* Look at URLs, response headers
* Check for sitemaps/robots.txt

#### Scan the server

```text
nikto -host 10.11.1.5
```

#### Scan for open directories

Dirbuster -  "go faster", medium word list, applicable files extension

```text
Microsoft IIS - .asp or .aspx
Apache - .php
Tomcat - .war
other - .pdf, .doc, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx
```

Dirsearch  \(/opt/dirsearch\)

```text
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.87.202:3333/ -e html -x 401,402,403
```

### 111 - Network File System \(NFS\)

NFS is a distributed file system protocol for sharing over a network. Often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its implementation. Portmapper and RPCbind both listen on port 111 and redirects clients to appropriate ports, often TCP 2049. 

#### Scan with nmap or use NSE scripts to locate NFS shares 

```text
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254 
```

#### Enumeration

```text
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72 
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo $RHOST 
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
rpcinfo -p $targetip
rpcbind -p $targetip
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $RHOST
showmount $targetip -a
```

#### Mounting shares

```text
mkdir home 
sudo mount -o nolock 10.11.1.72:/home ~/home/ 
```

If files aren't readable, you may be able to create a new user, then use sed to change the UUID of the user to match the requirements \(su username\)

### 135 - RPC

```text
nmap -n -v -sV -Pn -p 135 --script=msrpc-enum 192.168.1.10 
```

### 139/445 - NetBIOS/Server Message Block \(SMB\)

NetBIOS listens on TCP 139 and several UDP ports. SMB \(TCP 445\) and NetBIOS are separate protocols; however, modern implementations of SMB often utilize NetBIOS over TCP for backwards compatibility. SMB has a history of vulnerabilities but we are primarily interested in SMB for enumeration of shares to search for credentials, backups and other information that may help us gain a foothold.

We can search for NetBios/SMB hosts using nmap:

```text
nmap -v -p 139,445 10.11.1.1-254 sudo nbtscan -r 10.11.1.0/24 
```

#### NSE scripts

```text
nmap -p 139,445 --script=smb* 10.11.1.75
nmap --script=smb-enum* 10.11.1.227
nmap -p 139,445 --script=smb-enum-users 10.11.1.75
nmap -v -p 139,445 -oG smb.txt 10.11.1.1-245 –open
nmap --script smb-vuln-* 10.10.10.40
```

#### Enumeration

```text
smbclient -L \\$ip\\
smbclient -L \\\\$ip\\
smbclient -L \\\\$ip\\$share
sudo nbtscan -r 10.11.1.0/24 
enum4linux -a -v 10.11.1.227
rpcclient -U "" $targetip
```

#### Mounting shares

```text
mount -t cifs -o username=user,password=password //x.x.x.x/share /mnt/share
```

### 161 \(UDP\) - Simple Network Management Protocol \(SNMP\) 

SNMP is commonly misunderstood resulting in misconfigurations. 

#### Scan for SNMP 

```text
sudo nmap -sU --open -p 161 10.11.1.1-254 
```

#### Tools

```text
snmp-check $targetip
onesixtyone -c community -i $targetip
snmpwalk -c public -v1 -t10 10.11.1.219
```
