# 22 - SSH

SSH is not typically vulnerable but it often a candidate for password reuse attacks.  When enumerating you should check for:

* Version info (banner grab)

```
ssh 10.10.10.5
```

### NSE scripts

```
ssh2-enum-algos.nse -- reports algorithms supported
ssh-auth-methods.nse -- provides methods available for authentication
sshv1.nse -- checks for ssh v1 support
```

### SSH keys

When enumerating other services/shares, you should also look for SSH keys. Public keys are commonly stored as "authorized\_keys,", and private keys are commonly stored as "id\_rsa". If you locate a private key you may be able to connect  to the remote system via SSH.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa user@10.10.10.5
```

### Credential reuse

You should also attempt to connect to SSH with any credentials that you discover.

```
ssh user@10.10.10.5
```

### Creating keys (post exploitation)

```
ssh-keygen
```

### scp (file transfers over ssh)

```
scp -r username@target-ip:/path/to/foo /home/username/desktop/
```

Specifying key exchange algorithms

Occasionally on older systems you'll receive and error indicating that no compatible key exchanges were found. Use the following command(s) to force the use of a specific algorithm.

```
ssh -o KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@$TargetIP
ssh -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@TargetIP
```
